    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    For the batter:
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 heaped tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 cup cornmeal</li>
    </ul>
    For the pan:
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a heavy 10-inch nonstick skillet (or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) in the oven and pre-heat to 400 F.</li>
        <li>Whisk together all the wet batter ingredients with the sugar until smooth. Whisk in the flour and corn meal until just smooth. Don't over-mix.</li>
        <li>When the oven and pan are hot, take out the pan and put in the butter. Swirl it until it's melted. Use a paper towel to smear butter around the edges and also to absorb any excess. Pour in the batter and return the pan to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake 20-25 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean. Be careful not to over-bake. Let rest 5 minutes before turning out to cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
