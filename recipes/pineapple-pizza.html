        <strong>Pineapple pizzas</strong> are one of the highest-healing foods in RuneScape, healing 22 Hitpoints (11 per bite). Two bites of the same pizza can be eaten in quick succession, similar to a piece of regular food and a Karambwan. It can be made at level 65 Cooking by adding pineapple chunks or pineapple rings to a cooked plain pizza, granting 45 Cooking experience (for a total of 189 experience from start to finish).
        <br><br>
        It is recommended to cut the pineapple into rings, as it will yield four rings for use on multiple pizzas, compared to the single chunk if dicing it. The Cook from the Servants' Guild can also make pineapple pizzas, though it is slower and much more expensive.
