    <h1>Adam Ragusea's Lasanga</h1>
    <p>
        <em>Adam Ragusea is an American YouTuber who creates videos about food recipes, food science, and culinary culture. Until 2020, Ragusea was a professor of journalism at Mercer University. He has since gone on to create many food recipes on his self-titled youtube channel, mostly focusing on home-cook style dishes, as well as the occasional food science video that coincides with whatever he decides to film in the same week.</em>
