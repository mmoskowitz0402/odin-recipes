    <p>
        A <strong>Saradomin brew</strong> temporarily raises Hitpoints by 15% + 2 and Defence by 20% + 2 of their base levels, both rounded down, and can boost a player's Hitpoints above their maximum Hitpoints level by up to the amount healed. It also temporarily lowers Strength, Attack, Magic and Ranged by 10% + 2 of their current levels. Players typically bring super restore potions along with Saradomin brews to offset their stat reduction effect, as one dose of super restore is enough to restore lost stats from three doses of Saradomin brew, or up to four doses of brew if the player's stats were boosted beforehand (as with a super combat potion).
        <br><br>
        Used carefully, Saradomin brews can restore far more hitpoints per inventory slot than any other item. Saradomin brews are often used when fighting bosses, player killing, and in minigames such as the TzHaar Fight Cave. Its ability to heal above the maximum Hitpoints (similarly to anglerfish) as well as providing a slightly higher boost than a super defence potion also make it useful for tanking.
